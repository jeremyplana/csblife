"Be driven by the love of God because Jesus Christ died for all, that those who live may live not for themselves but for him, who died and rose for them. Above all, let your charity and zeal show how you love the Church. Your work is for the Church, which is the body of Christ."



St. John Baptist De La Salle said that we should always love God because Jesus himself died for our sake. We live not for ourselves but we live for Jesus Christ. Always live life not only for yourself but also for other people. 
Think for what's good for others and reflect yourself as what the mighty Lord did,
he gave his beloved son and was sent to death to save the whole world from sins. 
Let charity and love fill your heart and help as you can.You might not get any material as a reward but the real recognition is when you perished,
you'll be cherishing the sweetest things you'll ever had in heaven with God.We should always do our actions and deeds for the church because the Church is the body of Christ. St. John Baptist De La Salle tells us to always love and have faith in God. He tells us to do our deeds in life not for us but for Jesus Christ and the Church. 
Let charity and love fill your heart and help as you can.You might not get any material as a reward but the real recognition is when you perished,
you'll be cherishing the sweetest things you'll ever had in heaven with God.
