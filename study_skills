I failed some exam high. It is maybe because of my laziness of writing notes and teachers lecture. I always depend of classmates notes.

I think the midterm exam in CSB is not so hard if have a review. It’s like the high school examination. I also pass my all exams except history because our exam in history is more on facts and analysis.
