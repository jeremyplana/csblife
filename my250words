assignment#1
*new role
*new routine
*new relation

Once I have to study in de La Salle College. I thought that this will be just a forever dream until it became reality.
It really never expect that I’ll be studying here because we’re not rich and we can’t afford the tuition fee in this school. But then I was given a chance to study here after I passed a scholarship grant here in CSB.
There are many changes happened in me since I’d entered the world of college. At firs , it was an adjustment period within my time. I learn how to use my time wisely. Now I spend a lot of time for the homework’s and review unlike before I always spend most of my time for playing games particularly Dota.
Now that I am a college student, big responsibilities are loaded at my back. I can say how that I am more responsible- I always find ways to find an answer in every assignment that our Prof was given to us for they are to check if our assignment are copy-pasted from the internet.
My first wish was granted…. And now I have another wish-to finish my study in DLS-CSB with my course bachelor of science in Information Technology-Game dev although it is not my first choice, I will line up our country for it’s industry in the field of technology.
